# Hola!

I'm Monica Zarate, UX Designer and Web Developer.

Welcome to my portfolio website.

This site was built using React.js and SASS. From the project's directory, you can run:

`npm install`

To install the project's dependencies.

`npm start`

To run the app in development mode.

This website is a work in progress, and I'm constantly looking to improve the codebase and the showcased projects.

Have feedback, or just want to say hi?
